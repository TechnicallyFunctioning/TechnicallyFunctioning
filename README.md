Hi, Iâ€™m @TechnicallyFunctioning

I'm passionate about gaming and technology, especially when it comes to Virtual Reality.
Between coding, 3d modeling, audio, photo, and video editing, I always have a few projects waiting to be completed.

I'm currently learning C# for Unity with intent to break into the industry and develop the skills I need to complete more ambitious projects
